<!-- Add your reflection here
What did you learn about the DOM?
We learned about using Javascript to manipulate the DOM. This was my first look at using Javascript to manipulate CSS and HTML, so it kind of opened up a new world of possibilities for me. Using Javascript we are able to change CSS styles and HTML tags/inside tags. We could use conditional statements to make different things happen based on user input.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?
the .getElementById, .getElementsByTagName, are useful for manipulating certain parts of the HTML file. the .style method followed by a property name allows us to manipulate any CSS properties easily.
