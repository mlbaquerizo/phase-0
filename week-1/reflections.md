# 1.1 Think About Time

The productivity ideas that struck me the most were related to habits. 
This is absolutely something I want to employ now, after watching a few
videos on the concept of creating small, low-motivation habits to
nurture bigger, long term results. The way Fogg described his method
made sense on an intuitive level and his diagrams solidified that for
me.


Time-boxing is a way to complete a large task by using intervals in
which to work towards completing the task, rather than using up all of
the time before the task is complete. Each interval should include a
reflection period to evaluate what was done during that interval. It
can be used during Phase 0 in peer pairing to be productive and switch
between driving/navigating. It can also be used in solo-work to keep
focus.


Currently I do not employ a reliable time management strategy. I tend
to procrastinate until time is more limited thus motivating me to
complete any tasks as necessary. This strategy has worked for me in the
past but creates a high level of stress.


As stated before I am most eager to organize a system of small habits to
better my work flow and keep myself focused. As I am working full time
during Phase 0 I need to work hard to manage my time (I'm already
thinking: After I get home from work --> complete one-two
challenges/modules...).


# 1.2 The Command Line

####What is a shell? What is "bash?"

A shell is a computer user interface that can take in typed out commands
or inputs and yields outputs based on those commands/inputs. Bash is a
Unix-based shell which takes in specific commands (within the language
of bash) to explore and manipulate files and directories in a computer.


####What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

The most challenging part was the long tedious process of getting
through all the material.


####Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes, using terminal within the Cloud9 development environment, set up
as per DBC instruction. I was also able to successfully use most of the
commands (those that I was comfortable using on my own system -- I did
not want to edit anything in the environment) in Powershell in Windows
8.1



####In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?

From the commands/arguments I learned about, redirection and pipes are
very efficient ways of manipulating files and therefore seem very
useful. Grep and Cat are also important to know to view, find, and
create in files.



####Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

pwd : Print working directory (directory that is currently being
employed by user)

-ls : lists files/directories inside the working directory

-mv : move files or directories to other directories or edit name of
file/directory 

-cd : change working directory

-../ : move up a directory (can be chained to move up multiple
directories i.e ../../../../)

-touch : create a file inside the working directory

-mkdir : create a directory inside the working directory

-less : read contents of file

-rmdir : remove(delete) a directory

-rm : remove a file

-help : displays help text with various available commands and
descriptions


# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

Create a new repo in Github:

Sign in to Github
On the upper right hand corner of the page, click the "+" icon
Click "New Repository"
Name your repository, set privacy and other settings.
Click "Create Repository"


Fork a repo:

Find a repository that you want to fork (fork = make a copy of to edit without changing the original)
On the upper right hand corner of the page, click "Fork"
Choose the profile you would like to fork the repository to


Clone a repo:

Make sure you have your git profile set up in your terminal.

On Github, Navigate to the repository that you want to clone
Find the clone URL (next to the HTTPS button). Copy the clone URL to the clipboard
In the Terminal, navigate to the directory in which you would like to clone the repository to


Type: git clone [clone URL]
Forking a repository allows the user to have their own copy of that repository. Any changes they make to their copy will not affect the original copy. This is namely useful for contributing to open-source projects, or suggesting changes to the original creator's work.



What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

Setting up git and Github were relatively painless. I learned that the terminal is a LOT more powerful than I originally thought. It can get information from the internet and push information from my computer onto the internet! I also learned how useful git is for being efficient, productive, and able to collaborate with others.
