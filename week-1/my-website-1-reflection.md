####Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

####Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a repository on Github is as simple as clicking the "+" icon and "New
Repository", naming it under "Repository Name". Make sure to check the box next
to "Initialize this repository with a README" to be able to clone it to your local
computer. Copy the HTTPS link in the repository page (it's almost like the URL of
the repository page, but with a ".git" at the end of it).

To clone the repository, that is bring the repository from Github online to your
own computer's drive, open up your terminal/command line. Once you navigate to
the folder you want to put your repository in, type "git clone [insert HTTPS link
here]"


####Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the source code of a program, the code that makes up the
program, is available for anyone to view and hold a copy of. Anyone with a copy
can do various things with the source code, depending on the kind of licence
attached to it. 

####What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Anyone that is putting their code out there has made the choice to do so, so I
don't think there is any reason to be nervous or protective. Open source is great
to get other developers to contribute to your work, build on it, and ultimately
make it better. The first thing that usually comes to mind when I think about
open source after "free program" is "community effort." 


####Assess the importance of using licenses.

While open source programs and their source code are generally free to the public,
licenses may offer varying degrees of protection to the source code and/or the
original creator. Some licenses require that credit is given to the creator, others
restrict anyone from making money on the source code.

####What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I was able to get a stronger hold on the git workflow. In the previous challenge,
it was more me following directions and hoping everything worked out. With more
practice, I was able to actually tell myself what was actually going on with each
step in the process.
