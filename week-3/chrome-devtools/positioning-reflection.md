##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome DevTools is useful for playing around with your current styling and testing different styling options. What makes it great is that you get on the fly changes that you can see in the browser.
  
##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Elements on the DOM can be resized with the height/width properties in CSS.
  
##What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static
Static is the default position for an element. Elements are not affected by top, right, bottom, or left properties. They are positioned in relation to where they lie in the HTML file.   
  
Relative
Elements are positioned relative to the static position but can be moved with the top, right, bottom, and left properties. Also, "other elements will not be adjusted to fit into any gaps left by [a relatively positioned element]" --w3schools. I understand this to mean that moving an element with a position of relative will not affect any other elements on the page.
  
Absolute
An element that has a position of absolute is positioned in relation to its parent element (that has a position other than static). When the parent has a position of relative, it acts as the container for the element with position absolute. 
  
Fixed
Elements are positioned relative to the browser window and will stay in the same position on the screen when the page is scrolled.
  
##What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
These make up the box that every element is contained in. The content is contained in a box which has the three layers, padding, border, and margin, from the outside in. They are each able to be manipulated to achieve the desired positioning. Padding and margin are transparent, while border is able to be colored and styled.
  
##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
This challenge was a great exercise in positioning in CSS. We stumbled on some challenging parts and position settings took a while to grasp. We had a moment when we kind of started to get it though, which made the challenge worth while.
